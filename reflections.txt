How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
My gem uses define_method to loop through an array of colors and create a method for each one, as opposed to adding the methods manually.

How long did you spend working on this project?
A few hours.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Getting define_method to work.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I think there's a lot more I could learn to do with metaprogramming.
